    "2. **Data Transformation**: Restructuring the data by converting it into a different format or aggregating it to create new features that better suit the analysis or modeling objectives.\n",

    "3. **Data Enrichment**: Adding additional information to the dataset, often by merging it with other datasets to provide more context or depth.\n",

    "4. **Handling Missing Data**: Implementing strategies for dealing with missing values, such as imputation or removal, based on the nature of the data and the analysis goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dealing with Outliers**: Identifying and managing outliers that can skew the analysis or modeling results.\n",

    "6. **Data Formatting**: Ensuring that data types are consistent, and the data is in the appropriate format for analysis."
